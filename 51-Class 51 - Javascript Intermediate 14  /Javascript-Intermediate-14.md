## Explanations:

### 1. Dom Is Not A Part Of Javascript

DOM (Document Object Model) is indeed not a part of JavaScript itself but rather a representation of the structure of HTML documents, which JavaScript can manipulate. It provides a way for scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of HTML documents. JavaScript interacts with the DOM to create dynamic and interactive web pages.

### 2. What Is API (Application Programming Interface)

An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. APIs are commonly used to enable interaction between different software systems or to access services provided by remote servers.

### 3. What Is Web API

Web APIs are APIs specifically designed to be used over the web, typically using HTTP protocols. They allow web browsers to interact with remote servers to perform various tasks such as retrieving data, sending data, or performing operations. Examples of web APIs include the Fetch API for making HTTP requests, the Geolocation API for accessing a device's location, and the DOM API for manipulating HTML documents.

### 4. If All Things We Have Used Are Web APIs Then What Are Core Features Of JavaScript

While web APIs provide additional functionality and capabilities to JavaScript when running in a browser environment, the core features of JavaScript itself include its syntax, data types, operators, control structures (such as loops and conditionals), functions, objects, and more. These core features allow developers to write and execute code, manipulate data, control program flow, and perform various computations.

Core JavaScript encompasses the language itself, including its syntax, data types, operators, control structures, functions, and built-in objects. These are the fundamental components that make up the JavaScript programming language. While web APIs provide additional functionality for interacting with web browsers and servers, they build upon the foundation of core JavaScript.

Core JavaScript features are independent of any particular environment or platform and can be executed in various contexts, such as web browsers, server-side environments like Node.js, or even embedded systems.

Examples of core JavaScript features include:

- Variables and data types (e.g., numbers, strings, arrays, objects)
- Operators (e.g., arithmetic, comparison, logical)
- Control structures (e.g., if statements, loops)
- Functions and closures
- Object-oriented programming constructs (e.g., prototypes, classes)
- Error handling (e.g., try...catch statements)
- Asynchronous programming with promises and async/await

These core features are what make JavaScript a versatile and powerful programming language, capable of handling a wide range of tasks beyond just web development. While web APIs extend JavaScript's capabilities for web development specifically, the core language remains its foundation.

### 5. Function Argument Object

In JavaScript, every function has access to a special object called the "arguments" object, which contains an array-like list of the arguments passed to the function when it was called. This object allows functions to work with a variable number of arguments or to access arguments dynamically without explicitly declaring them in the function definition.

Example:

```javascript
function sum() {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
    total += arguments[i];
  }
  return total;
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); // Output: 6
```

### 6. Ternary Operator

The ternary operator is a concise way to write conditional statements in JavaScript. It takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (`?`), a value to return if the condition is true, and a value to return if the condition is false.

Example:

```javascript
let age = 20;
let status = (age >= 18) ? 'adult' : 'minor';
console.log(status); // Output: 'adult'
```

### 7. Ternary Operator vs Traditional if/else

The ternary operator and traditional if/else statements serve the same purpose: conditional execution of code based on a given condition. However, they differ in terms of syntax, readability, and appropriate use cases.

#### Ternary Operator:
- **Syntax**: `condition ? expr1 : expr2`
- **Readability**: Often used for simple, concise conditionals, which can enhance readability for straightforward cases.
- **Use Cases**: Suitable for short, one-line conditionals, particularly when assigning values or returning values based on conditions.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  let result = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";
  ```

#### Traditional if/else:
- **Syntax**: 
  ```javascript
  if (condition) {
    // code block if condition is true
  } else {
    // code block if condition is false
  }
  ```
- **Readability**: Provides more flexibility for complex conditions and multiple code blocks, which can improve readability for longer or more intricate conditionals.
- **Use Cases**: Suitable for more complex logic or scenarios where multiple conditions need to be evaluated.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  if (age >= 18) {
    result = "Adult";
  } else {
    result = "Minor";
  }
  ```

#### Comparison:
- **Readability**: Ternary operator is concise and can make simple conditionals more readable, while if/else statements are more suitable for complex logic.
- **Flexibility**: Ternary operator is limited to simple expressions, while if/else statements can handle more complex conditions and multiple code blocks.
- **Preference**: The choice between them often depends on personal preference, coding style guidelines, and the specific requirements of the codebase.

In general, choose the construct that best fits the specific situation and enhances the readability and maintainability of the code.

### 8. classList Object And its Methods

The `classList` object is a property of DOM elements that represents the classes applied to an element. It provides methods for adding, removing, toggling, and checking for the presence of CSS classes on an element without directly manipulating the `className` property.

Methods of `classList`:

- `add(className)`: Adds the specified class to the element.
- `remove(className)`: Removes the specified class from the element.
- `toggle(className)`: Toggles the presence of the specified class on the element.
- `contains(className)`: Returns a boolean indicating whether the element has the specified class.

### 9. Difference Between className And classList

- `className`: It is a property of DOM elements that represents the value of the `class` attribute of the element as a string. It allows direct manipulation of classes by assigning a new string containing space-separated class names.

Example:

```javascript
element.className = 'newClass';
```

- `classList`: It is a property of DOM elements that provides a more convenient way to work with classes by exposing methods for adding, removing, toggling, and checking for the presence of classes on an element.

Example:

```javascript
element.classList.add('newClass');
```

### 10. Overview Of Bulb Project

The "Bulb Project" is likely a hypothetical project aimed at demonstrating the use of JavaScript and the DOM to create an interactive webpage. It might involve toggling the state of a light bulb image using JavaScript events and DOM manipulation methods like `classList.toggle()`. This project could serve as a practical example to reinforce concepts learned during the lecture.

These topics cover a broad range of intermediate JavaScript concepts, from interacting with the DOM to working with functions and conditional statements. Understanding them will provide a solid foundation for further exploration of web development with JavaScript.

### Conclusion:
