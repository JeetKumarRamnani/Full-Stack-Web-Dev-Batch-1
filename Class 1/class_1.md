# Data

Data refers to raw facts that can be processed and interpreted.

# Information

Information is processed data that has been organized and given context, making it meaningful and useful.

# Resources

<!-- Resources are the assets or tools that are used to accomplish a task or achieve a goal. In the context of electronic devices, resources can include hardware components, software programs, and data storage. -->

# Connection

Connection refers to the establishment of a link or communication channel between two or more devices or networks, allowing them to exchange data and information.

# Protocols

Protocols are a set of rules and guidelines that govern the communication and interaction between devices or systems. They define the format, timing, and error control mechanisms for data transmission.

# IP Address

An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves as an identifier for the device and enables it to communicate with other devices on the network.

# Network

A network is a collection of interconnected devices or systems that can communicate and share resources. Networks can be categorized into Local Area Networks (LAN), Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN), and Wide Area Networks (WAN), based on their geographical coverage and scope.

# ISP (Internet Service Provider)

An Internet Service Provider (ISP) is a company or organization that provides internet access to customers. ISPs offer various types of connections, such as dial-up, broadband, and fiber optic, allowing users to connect to the internet and access online services.

# Internet

The internet is a global network of interconnected computer networks that enables the exchange of data and information worldwide. It connects millions of devices and networks, allowing them to communicate and share resources.

# History of Internet

The internet has its roots in the 1960s as a project called ARPANET, which was developed by the United States Department of Defense. Over time, it evolved into a global network, connecting universities, research institutions, and eventually, individuals around the world. The World Wide Web (WWW) played a significant role in popularizing the internet and making it accessible to a broader audience.

# Applications of Internet

The internet has a wide range of applications, including:

- Communication: Email, instant messaging, video conferencing.
- Information retrieval: Search engines, online databases, encyclopedias.
- E-commerce: Online shopping, electronic payments, banking.
- Entertainment: Streaming services, online gaming, social media.
- Education: E-learning, online courses, research.
- Collaboration: Cloud storage, file sharing, project management.

# Web/World Wide Web

The World Wide Web (WWW), often referred to as the web, is an information system built on top of the internet. It consists of interconnected documents and resources, accessed through web browsers, and linked together by hyperlinks. The web allows users to navigate between websites and access a vast array of information, services, and multimedia content.

# Difference Between Internet and Web

While the terms "internet" and "web" are often used interchangeably, they have distinct meanings:

- Internet: The internet is the global network infrastructure that connects devices and networks worldwide, enabling communication and data exchange.
- Web: The web is a subset of the internet, consisting of interconnected documents and resources accessed through browsers using HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).

# Client

A client refers to a computer or device that requests and uses services or resources from another computer or server. In a client-server model, the client initiates a request, and the server responds by providing the requested information or performing a specific task.

# Server

A server is a computer or device that provides services or resources to other computers or devices on a network. Servers respond to client requests and deliver the requested data or perform designated tasks.

# DNS

DNS (Domain Name System) is a decentralized naming system used to translate domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses. It allows users to access websites and other internet resources using memorable domain names instead of remembering numerical IP addresses.

# Browser

A browser is a software application that allows users to access and view websites and webpages. It retrieves and displays web content, interprets HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), executes scripts, and renders multimedia elements.

# Browser Engine

A browser engine, also known as a rendering engine, is the core software component of a web browser that interprets HTML, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and other web technologies. It processes the code and renders the visual representation of webpages to be displayed in the browser window.
