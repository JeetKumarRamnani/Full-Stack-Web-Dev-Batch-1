### Today's Class Agenda:

1. **What Is Git.**

   Git is a distributed version control system that enables developers to track changes in their codebase. It allows multiple people to work collaboratively on projects by maintaining a history of changes over time.

2. **What Is Version Control System.**

   A version control system (VCS) is a software that helps manage changes to files over time. It allows you to track modifications, revert to previous versions, and collaborate more efficiently.

3. **Why We Use Git.**

   Git offers several advantages, including:

   - **History Tracking**: It tracks changes, providing a detailed history of who made what changes and when.
   - **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work together on a project, merging their changes seamlessly.
   - **Branching and Merging**: Git allows for creating separate branches for features or fixes, which can be later merged into the main codebase.
   - **Backup and Recovery**: Changes are stored in a distributed manner, reducing the risk of data loss.
   - **Isolation**: Changes made by different developers do not interfere until they are intentionally merged.

4. **What Is GitHub.**

   GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It provides a user-friendly interface for collaboration, issue tracking, code review, and more. It's a central hub for open-source and private projects.

5. **Difference Between Git And GitHub.**

   Git is the actual version control system, while GitHub is a platform that hosts repositories. GitHub adds collaboration features, making it easier for multiple people to work on the same project.

6. **Making an Account On GitHub.**

   To use GitHub, you need to create a GitHub account. This account will be associated with your repositories and contributions.

7. **What Is a Repository.**

   A repository is a storage unit for your project. It contains all the project's files, folders, and the complete history of changes.

8. **Local and Remote Repositories.**

   A local repository is the version of the project on your computer, while a remote repository is hosted on a server, like GitHub. Remote repositories enable collaboration and backup.

9. **Git Most Used Commands.**

   Some of the most commonly used Git commands include:

   - `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository.
   - `git add`: Stages changes for commit.
   - `git commit`: Creates a snapshot of staged changes.
   - `git push`: Sends committed changes to a remote repository.
   - `git pull`: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them.

10. **Initializing Git For a Local Repository.**

    You can initialize a local repository in a directory using `git init`. This prepares the directory for version control.

11. **Why Do We Use Git Branches.**

    Branches allow developers to work on separate features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. This isolation prevents conflicts and enhances collaboration.

12. **GitHub Pages (gh-pages).**

    GitHub Pages is a feature that allows you to publish static web content directly from a GitHub repository. It's often used for personal websites, documentation, or project demos.

13. **Hosting a Project On GitHub using gh-pages.**

    You can host a project using GitHub Pages by creating a branch named `gh-pages` and adding your HTML, CSS, and other static files to it. GitHub will then automatically build and serve your website.

14. **Open-source Contribution (Forking And Pull Request).**

    Learn how to contribute to open-source projects by forking their repositories and creating pull requests. This process allows you to suggest changes, enhancements, or bug fixes to other developers' projects.
