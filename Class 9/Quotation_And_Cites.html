        When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they
        asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down ‘happy’. They told me I didn’t understand the
        assignment, and I told them they didn’t <q>understand life</q>
