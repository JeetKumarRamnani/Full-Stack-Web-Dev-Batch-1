Now, let's explain each topic in detail:

1. **What Actually Are Elements?**
   Elements are fundamental building blocks in HTML that define the structure and content of a webpage. They are represented by tags and usually consist of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Elements can be as simple as a paragraph `<p>` or more complex, like tables `<table>` or forms `<form>`.

2. **User Agent**
   A user agent is a piece of information sent by the web browser when it requests a webpage from a server. It identifies the software and device used to access the website. User agents typically include details about the browser, operating system, and device type.
   A user agent is a relatively short bit of text that (attempts to) describe the Software/Browser (the "Agent") that is making the request to a website. Web browsers include the user agent string in the requests they make to websites. The User Agent often includes descriptions of the Operating System and Device Type that the Browser/Agent is running on.

3. **Default Styles Given by User Agent/Browser to the Elements**
   Browsers apply default styles to various HTML elements to ensure consistent rendering across different websites. For example, headings may be bold, links may be blue, and paragraphs may have a certain font size.

4. **Types of Elements (Block and Inline)**
   Elements can be categorized as block-level or inline based on how they interact with other elements. Block-level elements start on a new line and occupy the full width available, while inline elements only take up as much space as necessary within a line.

5. **ID and Class Attributes (Identifying Elements)**
   Both ID and class attributes are used to identify and target specific HTML elements for styling or JavaScript interactions. IDs are unique, meaning they can only be used once on a page, while classes can be used multiple times.

   Note: The id name is case sensitive!

   Note: The id name must contain at least one character, cannot start with a number, and must not contain whitespaces (spaces, tabs, etc.).

6. **ID vs. Class**
   ID and class attributes serve similar purposes, but their main difference lies in their uniqueness. IDs must be unique on the page, while classes can be applied to multiple elements.

7. **HTML Bookmarks**
   HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a webpage easily. Bookmarks are created with the `id` attribute and can be linked to using anchor tags `<a>`.
