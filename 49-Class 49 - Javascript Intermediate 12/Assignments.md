### Assignment 1: "Object Properties Exploration"

Explore the properties of an object using the `for..in` loop. Create an object with various properties and use the loop to iterate over and log each property and its corresponding value.

### Assignment 2: "Array Exploration with forEach"

Practice using the `forEach` loop with arrays. Create an array of your choice and use the loop to log each element in the array.

### Assignment 3: "Understanding for..in vs for..of"

Highlight the differences between `for..in` and `for..of` loops. Create examples for each and explain when to use one over the other.

### Assignment 4: "Direct DOM Access with IDs"

Experiment with directly accessing DOM elements using their ID attribute values. Create a simple HTML document with multiple elements, assign IDs, and showcase direct access using the automatically created global variables.

### Assignment 5: "DOM Parent Manipulation"

Practice manipulating the parent elements of a given DOM element. Use methods like `replaceChild`, `removeChild`, and `insertBefore` to modify the structure of a sample HTML document.

### Assignment 6: "Child and Sibling Exploration"

Explore the child and sibling methods in the DOM. Create an HTML structure with parent, child, and sibling elements. Use methods like `nextElementSibling` and `previousElementSibling` to navigate and log results.

### Assignment 7: "Understanding parent.children vs parent.childNodes"

Compare and contrast `parent.children` and `parent.childNodes`. Create a scenario where knowing the difference is essential and explain why.

### Assignment 8: "Inline Events in Action"

Implement inline events in an HTML document. Create a button with an inline event handler and showcase its functionality by triggering an alert or other interactive action.

### Assignment 9: "Dynamic Event Handling"

Dynamically add an event handler to an HTML element using the `element.event` property. Create a scenario where the event is triggered by user interaction, such as clicking a button.

### Assignment 10: "Dynamic Element Creation and Event Handling"

Create a button dynamically using JavaScript and add it to an existing HTML document. Implement event handling for the dynamically created button, and when clicked, it should perform a specific action, such as toggling the visibility of another element or changing the content of a paragraph.
Feel free to adapt the assignments as needed and have fun exploring these JavaScript concepts!
