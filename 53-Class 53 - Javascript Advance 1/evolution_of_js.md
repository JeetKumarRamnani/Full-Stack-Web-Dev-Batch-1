JavaScript's history is closely intertwined with the development of ECMAScript, the standardized specification for the language. Here's a more detailed timeline focusing on ECMAScript:

1. **Birth of JavaScript (1995)**: JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications Corporation to add interactivity to web pages. It was initially named Mocha, then LiveScript, before settling on JavaScript.

2. **ECMAScript 1 (1997)**: Recognizing the need for standardization, Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA International for standardization. ECMAScript 1, based on JavaScript, was the first standardized version of the language.

3. **ECMAScript 2 (1998)**: This version brought minor updates and corrections to the ECMAScript 1 specification.

4. **ECMAScript 3 (1999)**: ECMAScript 3 was a significant update, introducing features like regular expressions, try/catch exception handling, and more. It formed the basis for JavaScript implementations for many years.

5. **ECMAScript 4 (Abandoned)**: The ECMAScript 4 project aimed to introduce major enhancements to the language, but disagreements over the proposed changes led to the project's abandonment in 2008.

6. **ECMAScript 5 (2009)**: With ECMAScript 4 abandoned, the focus shifted to a more incremental approach. ECMAScript 5 introduced new features like strict mode, JSON support, and array extras.

7. **ECMAScript 6 (2015)**: Also known as ES6 or ECMAScript 2015, this version brought significant enhancements to the language, including arrow functions, classes, template literals, and modules. ES6 marked a major milestone in the evolution of JavaScript.

8. **ECMAScript (Annually Updated)**: Following ES6, ECMAScript adopted a yearly release cycle, with new features being added regularly. This agile approach allows for faster evolution of the language.

9. **TC39 (Technical Committee 39)**: TC39 is the committee responsible for evolving the ECMAScript specification. It includes representatives from major tech companies and plays a crucial role in shaping the future of JavaScript.

10. **Current State**: JavaScript continues to evolve rapidly, with new features and improvements introduced regularly. Features like async/await, destructuring assignment, and spread syntax have further enhanced the language's capabilities.

The history of JavaScript and ECMAScript showcases the collaborative effort to standardize and evolve the language, enabling its widespread adoption and use in various domains, including web development, server-side programming, mobile app development, and more.
