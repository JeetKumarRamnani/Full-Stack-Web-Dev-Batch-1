## Explanations:

1. **What is a programming language?**

   A programming language is a way for people to communicate with computers. It's like a set of instructions or a special code that tells the computer what to do. When we write code in a programming language, the computer can follow our instructions and perform tasks like running software, playing games, or solving problems.

2. **Low-level language (Computer language/Machine language using binary 0s and 1s)**

   A low-level language is like talking to the computer in its secret language. It uses only two digits, 0 and 1, which the computer can understand directly. It's like giving very basic instructions to the computer, but it's very hard for people to use because it's not like the language we speak every day.

3. **High-level language (Human understandable, using English words)**

   High-level languages are like talking to the computer in a way that's much easier for people. We use words and phrases that are more like English, so it's more comfortable for us to write and read. Computers can still understand it, but they need some help to translate it into their own language.

4. **Difference between programming and scripting languages**

   Programming languages are used for creating big and complex software or applications. They are like making detailed plans for building a house, with lots of steps and rules. Scripting languages are used for smaller and quicker tasks, like making changes to a webpage. They are like giving the computer simple, one-time instructions, like telling it to change the color of a button when you click it.

5. **What is a compiler?**

   A compiler is like a translator for a high-level language. It takes all the instructions you've written in your language and turns them into a language the computer understands directly. It's like translating a whole book into another language. Once it's translated, the computer can use it anytime without needing the original instructions.

6. **What is an interpreter?**

   An interpreter is like a teacher who reads and explains the instructions to the computer one by one. It doesn't translate everything at once; instead, it reads and acts on each step as it goes. It's like following a recipe in a cookbook, one step at a time. Interpreters are good for quickly making things happen, but they need the original instructions every time you want to do something.

7. **Difference between a compiler and an interpreter**

   A compiler translates all the instructions at once, like turning a whole book into another language. An interpreter reads and carries out the instructions one by one, like following a recipe step by step. Compilers create programs that can be run without the original instructions, while interpreters need the instructions every time you want to run something.

8. **What is JavaScript?**

   JavaScript is a special language used on the internet. It's like the magic behind web pages that makes them interactive. When you click on things, see pop-up messages, or watch videos on the internet, it's often JavaScript making all of that happen. It's like the language of the web.

   Certainly, here are explanations for those topics:

9. **What You Need To Run/Execute JavaScript Code/Program/Statements?**

   To run or execute JavaScript code, you need the following:

   - **A Web Browser**: Most web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari, come with built-in JavaScript engines that can interpret and execute JavaScript code.

   - **A Text Editor**: You can use a text editor to write your JavaScript code. Common text editors include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Notepad.

   - **An Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: IDEs like Visual Studio Code or WebStorm provide a more feature-rich environment for writing, testing, and debugging JavaScript code.

   - **A Server Environment**: If you're working with server-side JavaScript (e.g., with Node.js), you need a server environment to execute your code on the server.

10. **What is JavaScript Runtime Environment?**

    A JavaScript runtime environment is a context in which JavaScript code is executed. It consists of two main components:

    - **JavaScript Engine**: This is the core component responsible for interpreting and executing JavaScript code. Browsers have their JavaScript engines (e.g., V8 for Chrome), and server-side environments like Node.js have their own engines (also V8).

    - **Web APIs (for browser environments)**: In browser-based runtime environments, web APIs provide additional functionality beyond the core JavaScript language. These APIs include features like the Document Object Model (DOM), XMLHttpRequest, and the Fetch API, which enable interaction with web pages.

    The runtime environment also includes other features such as the event loop, which manages asynchronous operations, and the global object, which represents the global context in which JavaScript code runs.

11. **What is a JavaScript Engine?**

    A JavaScript engine is a program or software component that interprets and executes JavaScript code. It's the core of a JavaScript runtime environment. Each web browser has its own JavaScript engine, and there are JavaScript engines for server-side environments like Node.js. Some well-known JavaScript engines include V8 (used in Chrome and Node.js), SpiderMonkey (used in Firefox), and JavaScriptCore (used in Safari).

    The JavaScript engine performs several important tasks, such as parsing JavaScript code, optimizing it for performance, and executing it. It also manages memory and handles interactions with the runtime environment's APIs (e.g., the DOM in a browser).

12. **JavaScript Runtime Environment and JavaScript Engine Are Same Thing Or Different?**

    JavaScript runtime environments and JavaScript engines are related but different components:

    - **JavaScript Engine**: This is the core component responsible for interpreting and executing JavaScript code. It handles the low-level tasks of parsing and executing JavaScript code.

    - **JavaScript Runtime Environment**: This is a higher-level concept that encompasses the JavaScript engine along with other environment-specific features. In a browser, the runtime environment includes the JavaScript engine and web APIs (like the DOM). In server-side environments like Node.js, it includes the engine and additional APIs for working with files and network operations.

    While the engine is the heart of the runtime environment, the runtime environment includes everything needed to execute JavaScript code effectively in a specific context. So, they are related, but not the same thing.

13. **Why are HTML and CSS not called programming languages, but JavaScript is?**

    HTML and CSS are essential for building web pages. HTML is like a blueprint that shows where things should be on a webpage, like text and images. CSS is like a decorator that makes everything look pretty. They don't tell the computer what to do; they handle how things look. JavaScript, on the other hand, can make web pages do things like calculations, show pop-up messages, and respond to your clicks, which is why it's called a programming language.

14. **Interesting story of the history of JavaScript**

    JavaScript was created in the 1990s by a programmer named Brendan Eich while he was working at Netscape. It had different names before it became "JavaScript," like "Mocha" and "LiveScript." Interestingly, the name "JavaScript" was partly a marketing decision and not related to the Java programming language. It was designed to add interactivity to web pages and has since become a fundamental part of the web.

15. **Browser wars**

    The "browser wars" were like a big competition between companies that made web browsers, such as Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, in the late 1990s and early 2000s. They were trying to outdo each other in creating the best web browser. This competition led to many improvements in web technology and helped shape the internet we use today.

16. **Mocha, LiveScript, JScript**

    "Mocha" was the original code name for JavaScript while it was being developed. "LiveScript" was a temporary name that was later changed to "JavaScript." "JScript" is a version of JavaScript created by Microsoft for their Internet Explorer browser.

17. **ECMA International**

    ECMA International is an organization that creates and maintains standards for information and communication technologies. It played an important role in standardizing JavaScript. It's like making sure that everyone follows the same set of rules when they use JavaScript.

18. **What is ECMAScript, and why is JavaScript called ECMAScript?**

    ECMAScript is like a rulebook for JavaScript. It defines the official standards for how JavaScript should work. JavaScript follows these standards to make sure it behaves the same way in different places. JavaScript is often called ECMAScript to show that it follows these rules and is a standard way of doing things in the world of web development. It's like giving JavaScript an official name to show that it plays by the rules.

19. **Need Of ECMA Standards For Javascript?**

    The standardization of JavaScript under the ECMAScript (ECMA) organization, often referred to as ECMAScript standards, was necessary for several specific reasons:

    1. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: As JavaScript became a fundamental part of web development, different browsers implemented it with variations. These differences in implementation created compatibility issues, making it challenging for developers to write code that worked consistently across various browsers. ECMAScript standards aim to establish a common baseline for JavaScript, ensuring that it behaves consistently regardless of the browser in use.

    2. **Consistency Across Implementations**: ECMAScript provides a clear and standardized specification for JavaScript. This specification ensures that different JavaScript engines in various web browsers and environments (like Node.js) can follow the same rules, making it easier for developers to predict how their code will behave.

    3. **Innovation and Evolution**: JavaScript is a dynamic language that continually evolves to meet the needs of modern web applications. ECMAScript standards provide a structured and organized way to introduce new features and capabilities while ensuring backward compatibility. This allows JavaScript to remain competitive and adapt to changing technological demands.

    4. **Developer Confidence**: With standardized ECMAScript, developers can have confidence that their code will work consistently across different environments. This predictability and reliability are crucial for building and maintaining complex web applications.

    5. **Language Integrity**: ECMAScript standards help maintain the integrity of the JavaScript language by preventing it from fragmenting into incompatible dialects. This ensures that JavaScript remains a cohesive, single language.

    6. **Community and Collaboration**: ECMAScript is developed through a collaborative process involving various stakeholders, including browser vendors, developers, and organizations. This collaborative effort fosters community involvement, and the standards are openly discussed and agreed upon.

    7. **Legal and Licensing Compliance**: By defining a clear standard, ECMAScript standards can address legal and licensing issues, providing clarity regarding intellectual property rights and licensing terms. This ensures that JavaScript remains open and accessible for all.

    In summary, ECMAScript standards were established to provide a common and consistent framework for JavaScript, enabling cross-browser compatibility, supporting innovation, and giving developers confidence in the language's predictability and integrity. These standards help JavaScript remain a vibrant and sustainable language for web development.
