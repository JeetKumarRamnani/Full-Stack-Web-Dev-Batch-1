1. **What Do You Mean By Nesting?**

   - Nesting, in the context of HTML, refers to placing one element inside another element.
   - This allows you to create more complex and organized structures on a webpage.

2. **Understanding the Parent-Child Relationship and Its Importance in Grasping Web Development Programming Behind the Scenes**

   - In HTML, elements can be nested inside other elements, creating a parent-child relationship.
   - The element containing another element is the parent, and the element inside it is the child.
   - Elements can have multiple children, and those children can also have children, forming a tree-like hierarchy.
   - Understanding this relationship is crucial for structuring and styling web pages properly.

3. **Nested Lists**

   - You can also nest lists inside each list item to create sublists.
   - For example, you can have an ordered list (`<ol>`) with list items (`<li>`), and inside each list item, you can have another unordered list (`<ul>`) with its list items (`<li>`).

**4. Links and Anchors**

Links play a crucial role in web development as they enable us to connect different web pages together and provide navigation throughout the internet. Additionally, they can be used to link to external resources such as documents, images, videos, or even email addresses. In HTML, links are created using the anchor element, denoted by `<a>`.

**1. The `<a>` (Anchor) Element:**
The anchor element, `<a>`, is the foundation for creating links. It consists of an opening `<a>` tag followed by the destination URL (Uniform Resource Locator) specified within the `href` attribute, and then closed with a closing `</a>` tag. The `href` attribute defines where the link should navigate the user when clicked.

Example of a basic link:

```
<a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
```

**2. The `target` Attribute:**
The `target` attribute can be used to determine how the linked content should be displayed when clicked. It specifies the target context or browsing context for the linked resource. The most commonly used values for the `target` attribute are:

- `_self`: The linked page will open in the same browser tab/window. This is the default behavior if `target` is not specified.
- `_blank`: The linked page will open in a new browser tab/window.
- `_parent`: The linked page will open in the parent frame if the current page is within a frameset.
- `_top`: The linked page will break out of any frameset and open in the full browser window.

Example using the `target` attribute:

```
<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example (Opens in a new tab)</a>
```

**3. The `title` Attribute:**
The `title` attribute provides additional information about the link. When a user hovers over the link, the text specified in the `title` attribute will be displayed as a tooltip, giving users more context about the destination.

Example using the `title` attribute:

```
<a href="https://example.com" title="This is an example website">Visit Example</a>
```

**4. Mailto Links:**
Mailto links are used to create links that, when clicked, open the user's default email client with a new message addressed to the specified email address.

Example of a mailto link:

```
<a href="mailto:info@example.com">Send Email</a>
```

**5. Tel Links:**
Tel links are used to create links that, when clicked on a mobile device, initiate a phone call to the specified phone number.

Example of a tel link:

```
<a href="tel:+1234567890">Call Us</a>
```

**6. Anchor Links (Internal Links):**
Anchor links are used to link to specific sections or elements within the same webpage. The `href` attribute is set to the `#` symbol followed by the ID of the target element.

Example of an anchor link:

```
<a href="#section2">Go to Section 2</a>
```

Make sure the target element has a corresponding `id` attribute:

```
<h2 id="section2">Section 2</h2>
```

**7. Linking to File Downloads:**
Links can also be used to provide downloadable files such as documents, images, or media files. The `href` attribute points to the location of the file, and the `download` attribute suggests that the linked resource should be downloaded instead of being navigated to.

Example of a link to a downloadable file:

```
<a href="documents/sample.docx" download>Download Document</a>
```

These are some essential points about links and anchors in HTML that will help you create effective and user-friendly navigation in your web pages. By using these attributes wisely, you can enhance the user experience and make your content more accessible and interactive.

5. **Text Formatting Tags**

   - HTML provides various tags to format text on web pages.
   - Examples include `<b>` for bold, `<i>` for italic, `<u>` for underline, `<em>` for emphasis, and `<strong>` for strong emphasis.

6. **What Are Comments And Its Purpose In Computer Languages**

   - Comments are non-executable statements used in computer languages to provide human-readable explanations or annotations within the code.
   - Comments are ignored by the compiler or interpreter and have no impact on the program's functionality.
   - The purpose of comments is to improve code readability, make it easier for other developers to understand the code, and provide notes for future reference.

7. **Comments In HTML**

   - In HTML, comments are created using the `<!--` and `-->` delimiters.
   - Anything between these delimiters will be treated as a comment and will not be rendered on the webpage.
   - HTML comments are useful for leaving notes about specific sections of code, explaining the purpose of elements, or temporarily disabling parts of the code during debugging.
