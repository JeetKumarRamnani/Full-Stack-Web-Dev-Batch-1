### Lecture 2: VS Code Installation, Text Editor Vs IDE Attributes And HTML Lists

#### Topics Covered:

## VS Code Installation

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a powerful and popular text editor developed by Microsoft. It is widely used by developers for web development, coding, and more. To install VS Code, follow these steps:

1. **Visit the Official Website:** Go to the official website of Visual Studio Code: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

2. **Download:** Click on the "Download for [Your Operating System]" button. VS Code supports Windows, macOS, and Linux.

3. **Run Installer:** Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install VS Code.

4. **Launch VS Code:** After the installation is complete, launch Visual Studio Code. You are now ready to start coding!

## What is a Text Editor?

A text editor is a software application that allows developers to create and edit text-based files. It is a fundamental tool for coding and programming tasks. Text editors offer various features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and indentation to improve code readability and productivity. Unlike word processors, text editors do not add formatting to the text, making them ideal for writing code.

## What is an IDE?

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software suite that combines various tools and features to facilitate software development. It typically includes a text editor, a debugger, a compiler, and other utilities for coding, testing, and debugging. IDEs provide an all-in-one solution, making it easier for developers to write, compile, and test their code within a single environment.

## Difference Between Text Editor and IDE

The main difference between a text editor and an IDE lies in their capabilities. A text editor is a lightweight tool that primarily focuses on text editing and code creation. It offers essential features like syntax highlighting and code indentation but lacks advanced development tools like debugging and project management.

On the other hand, an IDE is a comprehensive software suite that includes a text editor and additional tools like a debugger, compiler, and build automation. IDEs provide a complete development environment, enabling developers to perform tasks like code debugging, testing, and project management, all within a unified interface.

## Why VS Code is Called a Text Editor and Half IDE?

VS Code is often referred to as a "text editor and half IDE" due to its unique combination of features. While it is primarily a text editor at its core, VS Code offers an extensive array of extensions and plugins that bring it closer to the capabilities of a full-fledged IDE. These extensions provide advanced features for debugging, linting, testing, and more, making it a powerful and versatile tool for developers.

## What are Attributes?

1. **What are Attributes?**
   <opening tag>Content</ closing tag> = element

   - In HTML, attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and help modify their behavior or appearance.
   - Attributes are always specified within the opening tag of an element and consist of a name and a value.

   - In HTML, attributes are additional information or metadata provided within tags that modify the behavior or appearance of an HTML element. They are used to customize the elements and provide extra details to the browser about how the element should be rendered or interacted with.

   - Example: `<html lang="en">` In the example above, the attribute lang is used, and its value is "en", which signifies that the language used in the HTML document is English.

   - In the above example, `lang` is an attribute, and `"en"` is its respected value. Think of it like in maths we make variables:
     x = "2" it means x has a value of 2 Or x is 2
     lang = attribute name
     en = is lang attributes value

## Importance of Attributes and their Understanding in Web Development

Attributes play a crucial role in web development, as they enable developers to customize the behavior and appearance of HTML elements. By using attributes, developers can improve accessibility, make elements interactive, and enhance SEO. Understanding attributes is essential for creating well-structured and user-friendly web pages.

## Lists and Different Types of Lists (Ordered, Unordered, and Description List)

HTML supports three types of lists:

1. **Ordered Lists (`<ol>`):** Ordered lists represent items in a numbered sequence. Each list item is marked with a number by default.

2. **Unordered Lists (`<ul>`):** Unordered lists represent items with bullet points. Each list item is preceded by a bullet point by default.

3. **Description Lists (`<dl>`):** Description lists consist of terms (`<dt>`) and their corresponding descriptions (`<dd>`). They are often used for glossaries or definitions.

Using lists in HTML, developers can organize content efficiently and present information in a structured and user-friendly manner.
